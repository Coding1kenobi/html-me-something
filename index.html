<h2>Welcome to the Machine</h2>



<p id="mission-statement">My Name is Lance I make comics and shit.  </p>
<p>
<br>I have a website that's full of a bunch of
<br>my fucking comics.  They are  weird as hell.  
<br> <a href="http://www.piledrivercomix.com">Piledriver Comix</a>
<br>My dream was to try making a living off of comics, 
<br>but i guess you can't do that shit anymore so here we are.

<h2>Beyond Thunderdome</h2>
<p>I went to college for fucking art, and I guess none of the teachers
<br>felt obligated to tell us how little money was involved in the process.
<br>I guess it probably should've occurred to me that if making money were
<br>so easy for an artist, none of these people would've had to start teaching
<br>to make ends meet. But you know I was a damn teenager, I didn't know any better.

<h2>Return to Fuck Mountain</h2>
<p>So I figured out that the gallery scene wasn't for me pretty quickly.
<br>but at that point I had fallen in love with comic books and thought
<br>I'd just try my hardest to make a living off the thing that I love most.
<br>The first roadblock was just getting people to read the stuff I had made.
<br>I had my damn website for over a year, I think during that time maybe about
<br>15 people had read any of it, including my fuckin' Mom. I was just on the 
<br>verge of quitting forever when I finally decided to post some of my shit on reddit 
<br>and it blew the fuck up.  I got about 57,000 hits in one day.  So, I had my
<br>audience, time to make some money right? WRONG!

<h2>Return to Fuck Mountain 2: The Enfuckening</h2>
<p>Turns out there is very little money to be made.  Even for the most famous and 
<br>and successful comic creators in the world, its mainly a side gig.  There is the
<br>odd success story.  But its kind of like trying to be Justin Bieber or that Zayn
<br>kid.  And most of those who "support" themselves with comics are actually trust
<br>fund babies with free housing.  So I guess I'm pretty much screwed unless I murder
<br>my parents for insurance or something, but I don't think they're gonna leave me that much anyway    
<br>I think the most annoying part is that I'm actually really damn good at this.
